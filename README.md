 # Short intro

As a web developer, I wanted to inspire myself by creating something that would make it easy and enjoyable for individuals who enjoy buying food online. After thinking about it for a while ,I had the notion to start a website that delivered food. Groffy foodie is designed to provide you the flexibility to place an order from anywhere at any time without having to stop what you're doing.

# Team members

Working together to solve problems produces greater results when building a website. Chacha Alex and I make up our team. Chacha Alex worked on ux design, and I on front end. Our goal was to create a consumer friendly app.The target audience for this app are people who are at work or are busy and do not have time to go out for food or drinks.
